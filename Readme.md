## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your NAS's web directory
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory (see Configuration section below)
3. Ensure your web server has PHP enabled
4. Access your site through your domain or IP address

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```
# Directory browser configuration
BASE_DIR=./directory-to-share
PASSWORD=your_secure_password
ENCRYPTION_KEY=use_a_strong_random_32_character_key

# Site customization
SITE_TITLE=My Directory Browser
SITE_STATS=Custom message for the footer goes here!

# Files and directories to exclude from listing
# Comma-separated list
EXCLUDED_ITEMS=@eaDir,#recycle,.DS_Store,Desktop DB,Desktop DF

# Environment (development/production)
ENVIRONMENT=production
```

### Important Notes:
- Replace `your_secure_password` with a strong password
- Generate a strong `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (you can use `openssl rand -hex 16` in terminal)
- Set `BASE_DIR` to the directory you want to share
- Customize `SITE_TITLE` and `SITE_STATS` to personalize your site

## Synology NAS Setup Guide

### 1. Install Web Station

1. Open DSM (Synology's operating system)
2. Go to Package Center
3. Search for and install "Web Station"

### 2. Enable External Access

#### Firewall Rules

On your router you will need to configure the following:

- Port 80 (HTTP): Forward to your NAS's internal IP address
- Port 443 (HTTPS): Forward to your NAS's internal IP address

#### Domain Name Setup

1. Open DSM
2. Go to Control Panel
3. Select External Access
4. Click on the DDNS tab
5. Click Add

You can use any DDNS service. [No-IP](https://www.noip.com/) is recommended for its simplicity. Note that the domain credentials will be different from your No-IP account login.

#### SSL Certificate (Recommended)

1. In Control Panel ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Certificate 
2. Set up Let's Encrypt for free HTTPS
3. You'll need to be able to access your website from your domain name

### 3. Link Your Content Directory

Connect to your NAS via SSH:

```bash
ssh admin@your-nas-ip
```

Create the directory for the web folder:

```bash
mkdir -p /volume1/web/directoryname
```

Use the `mount --bind` command to make your content available:

```bash
sudo mount --bind /volume1/path/to/your/files /volume1/web/directoryname
```

Make this mount persistent across reboots by editing the rc.local file:

```bash
sudo vi /etc/rc.local
```

Add this command before the `exit 0` line:

```bash
sudo mount --bind /volume1/path/to/your/files /volume1/web/directoryname
```

Save and exit (press Esc, then type `:wq` and press Enter)

## Security Considerations

- Always use HTTPS with a valid SSL certificate
- Choose a strong password and encryption key
- Regularly update your PHP version
- Be careful about what content you share
- Consider setting up a reverse proxy for added security

## Troubleshooting

- If files don't display, check file permissions
- Ensure PHP has read access to your content directory
- Check web server logs for any errors
- Verify that the .env file is properly formatted
- Make sure the `mount --bind` command was successful
